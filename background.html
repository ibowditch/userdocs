<h2>In the beginning…<a class="headerlink" href="#in-the-beginning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This project started several years ago, when I decided to build a web application to help automate some of the
admin tasks that were taking a lot of volunteer time at my local brigade.</p>
<p>It started with capturing attendance records, then grew to include reporting, scheduling, and various other odds and ends.</p>
<p>My background as a software engineer (in a past life) came in handy, but there was still a big learning curve, and I
continue to improve the application as the technology improves, and I find better ways of doing things.</p>
<p>It has been operating for 4 years now, including through the major fires of 2019-2020, starting with my home brigade,
and then growing to another 3 brigades, with more than 300 users.</p>

<section id="legal-requirements">
<h2>Legal Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#legal-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Executive at all RFS brigades are required,
by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/44098/1.4.3-Public-Access-to-Government-Information-v1.0.pdf">State law</a>, to ensure that all members and visitors
record their attendance when participating in brigade activities.</p>
<p>Traditionally, attendance was recorded in an Attendance Book, normally placed at the
front of the station. Officers completed the details of the activity at the top of each page,
then members who attended recorded their details, including arrival and departure times and
their signature.</p>
<p>Attendance records are <a class="reference external" href="https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/pdf/asmade/act-1998-17">State Records</a>, and must be
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/171471/2.1.7-Management-of-Brigade-Records.pdf">kept for at least 25 years</a>.
They are occasionally required during Coronial or other enquiries, and they
must be an accurate record of who attended and for what purpose. The Officer In Charge (OIC) of
each activity is required to check and sign-off on attendance records for activities that they
organise.</p>

<section id="problems-with-paper">
<h2>Problems with paper<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-with-paper" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Keeping handwritten attendance records has some significant drawbacks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Often written records are messy, sometimes illegible, inconsistent or inaccurate, and require
interpretation and follow-up to correct.</p></li>
<li><p>The Attendance Book is always physically at the station, and the information it holds is not
available anywhere else.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no backup - if the Attendance Book is lost or damaged, important records will be lost forever.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping a physical Attendance Book can be unhygienic, as it (and the shared pen) is
touched by many Members, and could be a vector for infections such as flu or COVID-19.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="electronic-attendance-records">
<h2>Electronic Attendance records<a class="headerlink" href="#electronic-attendance-records" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The original Attendance Book is generally fine for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements to record attendance.</p>
<p>However, Attendance Records also contain information that is useful for brigade management, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gauging participation of members, especially to recognise outstanding contributions, but also to
identify members who are no longer active.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaining visibility on who is doing what in the brigade (and how much), especially for identifying opportunities
to “share the load”.</p></li>
<li><p>Capacity planning - review the membership and check the brigade has sufficient numbers and skills to meet expectations
and commitments in all areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Training planning - lack of participation in certain areas can indicate that training is needed, to prevent
loss of skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Determining who is entitled to vote in brigade elections, if there is some attendance criteria
for this (eg. minimum of 60 hours during the years)</p></li>
<li><p>Summarising activity for reporting purposes, to identify trends in types of activity, and to inform
district headquarters and other stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, many brigades transcribe the information from the Attendance Book into a spreadsheet
or database, so that it can be analysed and summarised. This is a slow and tedious manual process, which requires
a great deal of effort on the part of volunteer members.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Why not use ACTIV?</p>
<p>ACTIV is an excellent system for relaying callouts to members, and assisting with forming crews for these
callouts.</p>
<p>However, at the moment, it does not have a reliable way of recording attendance at the station.</p>
<p>It can detect your proximity to the station from your phone (including when driving past the station),
but this is not the same as attendance, and does not meet the current requirements of the SOPs and legislation for
reliable and accurate attendance records.</p>

<section id="how-it-works">
<h2>How it works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All Brigade Members are issued with a small key fob tag, which will be used for signing in and
out at the Station.</p>
<p>The OIC organising an activity schedules the event online in advance, using a phone, tablet or PC.</p>
<p>On the day of the activity, Members arriving at the Station will see the activities planned
for that day on a screen at the entrance of the Station.</p>
<p>Members will then tap their tag on a reader to sign-in. If there is a only one activity
planned at that time, they will be automatically signed in. If there is more than one
activity planned at that time, they will be asked to choose their activity.</p>
<p>When a Member has finished, they should tap their tag on the reader to sign-out.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Electronic Sign-in<a class="headerlink" href="#benefits-of-electronic-sign-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Electronic tagging can completely replace the paper Attendance Book.</p></li>
<li><p>Attendance records are collected automatically and stored by a web application in the cloud. No transcription or
checking is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Attendance records and reports are accessible to all members (login required).</p></li>
<li><p>Cloud based servers on Amazon Web Services can be accessed securely from anywhere,
on any device, 24x7, using only a browser and internet connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Highly secure and reliable servers, provide regular automatic database backups.</p></li>
<li><p>Data access is controlled by role. Officers can see and do more than ordinary members.
eg. Personnel Officer can monitor attendance of new members and detect lack of attendance</p></li>
<li><p>A comprehensive and powerful administration interface is available for Brigade administrators.</p></li>
