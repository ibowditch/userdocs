# Sign-in Server (Under construction)

The entire system is a web application, which runs on a server in the cloud (in our case, Amazon Web services).

All interactions with the system, including from the Kiosk, are made through this web application.

The Kiosk is the "shop front" of the system, and is used most frequently by most users. As well as being the backend 
for the Kiosk, the server can be accessed by all members, for a variety of services, detailed below.

#### Upcoming Events

#### Member Activity

The Member Activity report can now show all activities that were previously excluded, if you check the box 
"Add Excluded Events". All events recorded during the season, without exception, will be shown in the table and 
included in the totals, even if you marked them as excluded in the Brigade Settings (see below). 
Unchecking the box will remove all excluded activity types.
Activity types are organised in groups, and these groups are shown as headings in the Member Activity Report. 
If all event types in a group are excluded in Brigade Settings, and the check box "Add Excluded Events" is not checked, 
the group heading, eg. External, will not be shown in the Member Activity table.
If you drill down on any item in the Member Activity table, it will show a list of events represented by that item. 
This page also has a "Show Excluded Events" check box, and if it is checked, it will show events that would normally 
be excluded in grey, otherwise, they will not be shown at all.
The admin page for Brigade Settings has been tidied up. Activity Types for New Events shows the activity types that 
will appear in the drop down box when creating a new event. This list is now shown as checkboxes - check each item 
you want to appear when creating new events.  The list also shows the group the activity belongs to, 
eg.  Additional: Meeting, belongs to group "Additional".
Also in Brigade Settings, beside the Activity Types for New Events list is the list of Activity Types excluded 
from Member Activity Report. If you check an item in this list, all activities of this type will be excluded from 
the Member Activity Report. You would normally exclude Social: Social/Personal, but you can also exclude all Incidents, 
or External activities, or anything else you want. As noted above, activities that would normally be excluded 
(and not shown), can be revealed temporarily with the new "Add Excluded Events" button.
