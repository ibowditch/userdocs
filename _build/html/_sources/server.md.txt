# Sign-in Server (Under construction)

The entire system is a web application, which runs on a server in the cloud (in our case, Amazon Web services).

All interactions with the system, including from the Kiosk, are made through this web application.

The Kiosk is the "shop front" of the system, and is used most frequently by most users. As well as being the backend 
for the Kiosk, the server can be accessed by all members, for a variety of services, detailed below.
