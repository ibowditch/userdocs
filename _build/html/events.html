<h1>Events<a class="headerlink" href="#events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Events are a central part of the sign-in system. When you attend the station, you sign-in to an activity that is
occurring at the station, in the same way that you signed into an activity on the old Attendance Book. The details
of the activity were given at the top of the page in the Attendance Book, including the date, OIC, a description
of the activity etc.</p>
<p>An Event on the sign-in system is just like a page in the Attendance book. When you create an Event, you provide the
same details as if you were filling in the top of the page in the Attendance book.</p>
<p>When these details have been supplied, you will have a new event that members can sign-in to.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title">Anatomy of an Event</p>
<p>An event consists of a heading, containing information previously held in the heading of a page in the Attendance Book,
and a list of attendees, including when they signed-in and signed out.</p>

<p class="topic-title">Event Types and Controls</p>
<p>Events come in the following types:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Open/available</p>
<p>Events become open 1 hour before their start time and remain open until their end time. When they are open,
they will accept sign-ins from members either using a tag, or using the sign-in icon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Closed/completed</p>
<p>Events close when their finish time has passed. They will be shown with a grey background when they are
closed, and will not accept sign-in attempts with a tag. The sign-in icon will also be removed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Future</p>
<p>Events starting more than 1 hour in the future are shown with a dashed border. They will not be available
to sign-in with a tag, and no sign-in icon is shown for future events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overnight</p>
<p>Normally, events are removed from the kiosk at midnight when the display is updated. However, you can specify
that an event runs overnight by giving a finish time in the next day. The kiosk shows all events that start
<strong>or end</strong> on the current day, so such an event will appear on the start day and on the end day. This allows
crew to sign out when they return from night shift.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overlapping</p>
<p>Events can overlap and/or run simultaneously. When they do, members will be asked to choose which event they
want to attend when they tag in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Set the end time for overnight events</p>
<p>If the OIC doesn’t set the end time of an event so that it end the next day, members won’t be able to sign-out
when they return from their shift, as the event won’t be shown on the kiosk.</p>
<p>If there’s any chance you might be out past midnight (like Cinderella), make sure you set the end time past midnight.
If you get back early, no problem.</p>

<p>Pager Calls are detected by separate system which automagically creates a new event on the server
as soon as a callout is received for your brigade.</p>
<p>The event should be available for members to sign-in to when they arrive at the station.</p>
