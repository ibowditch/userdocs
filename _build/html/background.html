<p>The RFStag system is a web application that allows RFS members to sign-in and sign-out at their station using a small
NFC keyfob tag, rather than writing their details in the Attendance Book.</p>
<p>Tags are issued to all members, and they can sign-in just by tapping their tag on a reader attached to a
<a class="reference internal" href="kiosk.html#kioskh"><span class="std std-ref">terminal</span></a> at the station entrance. They can sign-out when they have finished the activity by tapping
their tag on the reader a second time.</p>
<p>All attendance records are stored electronically, and reports and summaries of attendance are available to members and
officers through a <a class="reference internal" href="server.html#serverh"><span class="std std-ref">web portal</span></a> which can be accessed from anywhere, on any device with an internet
connection and a browser (login required).</p>
<p>The system records attendance for all members, but visitors who do not have a tag should still record their details in
the (paper) Attendance Book.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<span id="attbook-records"></span><h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All RFS brigades are required,
by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/44098/1.4.3-Public-Access-to-Government-Information-v1.0.pdf">State Law</a>,
to ensure that all members and visitors record their attendance when participating in brigade activities. These records
are occasionally required during Coronial or other enquiries, and may also be used to support claims under
Workers Compensation legislation, among other things.</p>
<p>Traditionally, attendance was recorded in an Attendance Book, normally placed at the
front of the station. Brigade Officers completed the details of the activity at the top of each page,
then members who attended recorded their details, including arrival and departure times and
their signature.</p>
<p>This may seem like a chore, but it is in place to protect Members.</p>
<p><strong>The main reason for keeping attendance records is to ensure that there is a reliable record of Member activity
that can be used in cases of accident or misadventure, especially when a Workers Compensation Claim is lodged.</strong></p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.1. </span>Attendance Record Keeping<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance-record-keeping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The paper Attendance Book provided a way to collect and preserve attendance records in a secure, controlled, and
organised way, so that these records would be accurate, reliable, credible, and available for future reference
whenever needed.</p>
<p>Used correctly, the Attendance Book provides solid, lasting, evidence that a Member was involved in an activity. The
following table shows how the Attendance Book meets these requirements, and also how RFSTag does the same:</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Why not use RFS ACTIV?</p>
<p>RFS ACTIV is an excellent system for relaying callouts to members, and assisting with forming crews
for these callouts.</p>
<p>However, at the moment, it does not have a reliable way of recording attendance at the station.</p>
<p>It can detect your proximity to the station from the GPS on your phone (including when driving past the station),
but this is not the same as attendance, and it does not meet some key requirements above.</p>
<p>It relies on all members having mobile phones switched on at all times, and for those phones to have GPS tracking
enabled at all times, which may not be feasible, or even acceptable for some members.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.2. </span>Drawbacks of the Attendance Book<a class="headerlink" href="#drawbacks-of-the-attendance-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Even though the paper Attendance Book meets all the above requirements, there are some significant drawbacks with
keeping handwritten attendance records:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Often written records are messy, sometimes illegible, inconsistent or inaccurate, and require
interpretation and follow-up to correct.</p></li>
<li><p>The Attendance Book is always physically at the station, and the information it holds is not
available anywhere else.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no backup - if the Attendance Book is lost or damaged, important records will be lost forever.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping a physical Attendance Book can be unhygienic, as it (and the often shared pen) is
touched by many Members, and could be a vector for infections such as flu or COVID-19.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>RFSTag addresses all these issues by collecting and storing attendance records electronically at the <a class="reference internal" href="kiosk.html#kioskh"><span class="std std-ref">Kiosk</span></a>,
and providing access to these records and reports using the <a class="reference internal" href="server.html#serverh"><span class="std std-ref">web portal</span></a>.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.3. </span>Additional System Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-system-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As well as meeting the above requirements, this is what I was aiming to do with the new system:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" id="availreq">
<li><p>Provide an easy and quick way for members to sign-in to activities at the RFS station, modelled on existing
procedures used with the Attendance Book.</p></li>
<li><p>Capture attendance details in electronic form to eliminate the need to transcribe attendance data.</p></li>
<li><p>Simple admin procedures, with minimal intervention required by brigade management to keep the system up to date
and running.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve visibility and availability of attendance data to all brigade members and management.</p></li>
<li><p>Further reduce admin effort by automatically producing useful reports, based on attendance data.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a low-cost solution, using off-the-shelf hardware, and a modest annual subscription fee.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide high availability, reliability, and data security, including regular automatic backups.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure data privacy, with user accounts and passwords required for access.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="unlocking-the-value-of-attendance-data">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.1.4. </span>Unlocking the Value of Attendance Data<a class="headerlink" href="#unlocking-the-value-of-attendance-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The original Attendance Book is generally fine for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements to record attendance.</p>
<p>However, Attendance Records also contain information that is useful for brigade management, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gauging participation of members, especially to recognise outstanding contributions, but also to
easily identify members who are no longer active.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaining visibility on who is doing what in the brigade (and how much), especially for identifying opportunities
to “share the load”.</p></li>
<li><p>Capacity planning - review the membership and check the brigade has sufficient numbers and skills to meet expectations
and commitments in all areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Training planning - lack of participation in certain areas can indicate that training is needed, to prevent
loss of skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Determining who is entitled to vote in brigade elections, if there is some attendance criteria
for this (e.g. minimum of 60 hours during the years)</p></li>
<li><p>Summarising activity for reporting purposes, to identify trends in types of activity, and to inform
district headquarters and other stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Real time updates of who is at station can be provided to Officers, Members and HQ if attendance records
are available on-line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To realise the value of attendance data, many brigades transcribe the information from the Attendance Book
into a spreadsheet or database, so that it can be analysed and summarised. This is a slow and tedious manual
process, which requires a great deal of effort on the part of volunteer members.</p>
<p>RFSTag utilises the attendance records collected at the <a class="reference internal" href="kiosk.html#kioskh"><span class="std std-ref">Kiosk</span></a> to provide access to all the above
data to all members via the <a class="reference internal" href="server.html#serverh"><span class="std std-ref">web portal</span></a>, without the need to collect or transcribe any additional data.</p>
<!--

Collecting attendance records electronically reduces admin overheads, and allows brigades to more easily extract 
the useful data they contain to help run the brigade more efficiently.

<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>About the Project<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This project to build an electronic sign-in system started in 2018, when I decided to build a web application to
help automate some admin tasks that were taking a lot of volunteer time at my local brigade.</p>
<p>It started with capturing attendance records, then grew to include reporting, scheduling, and various other odds and ends.</p>
<p>My background both as a software engineer (in a past life) and as a former Deputy Captain, came in handy, but there was
still a big learning curve, and I continue to improve the application as the technology evolves, and as I find better
ways of doing things.</p>
<p>The system first went live in November 2018, and has been running (almost) continuously since then, including through
the major fires of 2019-2020.</p>
<p>The user base started with my home brigade (~70 members), then grew to include another 3 brigades, and it now supports
more than 300 users.</p>
